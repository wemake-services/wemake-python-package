# How to contribute

## Dependencies

We use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage the dependencies.

To install them you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
poetry install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell` or `source .venv/bin/activate`.

## One magic command

Run `make test` to run everything we have!

## Tests

To run tests:

```bash
make unit
```

To run linting:

```bash
make lint
```

These steps are mandatory during the CI.

## Submitting your code

We use [trunk based](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)
development (we also sometimes call it `wemake-git-flow`).

What the point of this method?

1. We use protected `master` branch,
   so the only way to push your code is via pull request
2. We use issue branches: to implement a new feature or to fix a bug
   create a new branch named `issue-$TASKNUMBER`
3. Then create a pull request to `master` branch
4. We use `git tag`s to make releases, so we can track what has changed
   since the latest release

So, this way we achieve an easy and scalable development process
which frees us from merging hell and long-living branches.

In this method, the latest version of the app is always in the `master` branch.

### Before submitting

Before submitting your code please do the following steps:

1. Run `make test` to make sure everything was working before
2. Add any changes you want
3. Add tests for the new changes
4. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a quick summary of your changes
6. Run `make test` again to make sure it is still working
